   Violation between Board Outline Clearance(Outline Edge): (Collision < 10mil) Between Board Edge And Text "Notes:
QFM current sensor is a BIG bottleneck in layout and current flow. Sadly unavoidable?

Not happy with MCU placement and Vin sensor, but space limitations require it? It leaves Vin very vulnerable to noise! However, no room for traverse on bottom layer.

Space limitations sadly mean board must be very compact. How will we mount? Leave vias for bolts? Worst case we can just tap holes once PCB manufactured.
